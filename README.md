## PDFRpt

I built this library because I didn't think iText - a Java PDF generation library - was very easy to use. This distribution includes an (old) copy of PDFRpt and is completely documented in javadoc.

Features:

* Relative positioning (this is 3px to the right/left/top/bottom of that)
* Page numbering
* Handling of page overflow
* General niceness
